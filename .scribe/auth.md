# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {BEARER_TOKEN}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

Use the token returned by the register or login endpoint as a Bearer token.
